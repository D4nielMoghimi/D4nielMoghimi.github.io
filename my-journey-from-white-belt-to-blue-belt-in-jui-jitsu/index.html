  <p>I was promoted to blue belt in Brazilian Jui-Jitsu (BJJ) by master Baret Yoshida. This achievement was long due, and I am very excited about it. Master B (AKA <em>The Finisher!!</em>) does not make it easy, but he makes it worth it.</p>
<p><a href="/images/bjj-bluebelt.jpg"><img src="/images/bjj-bluebelt.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I started training Jui-Jitsu in the middle of my PhD studies. Lifting weights was boring and didn&rsquo;t even help me get my head off work. I joined an MMA club at the university, and eventually, I started to like the grappling part (beginner-Jui-Jitsu). So I signed up at the only Jui-Jitsu gym nearby, <a href="https://worcestermma.com/">Worcester MMA</a>, and trained from August 2018 until January 2020 (about 1.5 years). Sadly, I had to stop training for more than a year due to the Coronavirus pandemic closing down gyms. I got back to it, going to <a href="https://www.thearenagym.com/">the Arena</a> here in San Diego from May 2021 until today (1 year and three months). There were, of course, many things in between that kept me away for weeks: work deadlines and travels, and some sickness and minor injuries that kept me away for weeks every time.</p>
<p>Promotion is very slow in Jui-Jitsu. There are four belt promotions until you become a master (blue, purple, brown, black). And you have to earn each level after a lot of hard work. There is no defined rule on how long you train to get promoted. Various professors may do this differently, but, roughly speaking, it will take at least two years to earn the blue belt for most people with a day job and under a coach like master B, who sets a high bar. And this is assuming consistent training in an ideal situation, but life happens.</p>
<p>What does it mean to earn a blue belt in Jui-Jitsu? It could mean many things, but here are some explanations that make sense to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A blue belt is considered a dedicated and serious student of BJJ. As a blue belt, a student&rsquo;s main objective is to learn as much as possible about all the different techniques and styles. It is important to develop breadth of knowledge before depth.
(<a href="https://eastonbjj.com/brazilian-jiu-jitsu/2019/know-your-colors/">https://eastonbjj.com/brazilian-jiu-jitsu/2019/know-your-colors/</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Students at the blue belt level will have a strong idea as to how to attack and have one &ldquo;go to&rdquo; attack in every position
(<a href="https://www.infighting.ca/bjj/the-bjj-belt-system-the-mental-attitude-for-each-belt/">https://www.infighting.ca/bjj/the-bjj-belt-system-the-mental-attitude-for-each-belt/</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you beat white belts at least 80% of the time, and untrained opponents &gt;95% of the time&quot;
(<a href="https://bjjmore.com/bjj-belts-meaning/">https://bjjmore.com/bjj-belts-meaning/</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my experience, these meant hundreds of hours of training. Why does it take so long? There is a reason they call Jui-Jitsu, the body chess. One cannot learn Jui-Jitsu by reading books and watching youtube (trust me, I tried). Those things helped me to build some knowledge, but I had to drill every technique hundreds of times. At this point, I probably have performed hundreds of arm bars (my favorite submission), chokes, and kimuras. I probably have also tapped hundreds of times on the Jui-Jitsu mat (a way to communicate to the opponent to stop in JuiJitsu). One cannot also show up to the gym mindlessly. I have to put more than 100% focus when I am training (which is a good way to get out of my head). If you do not, at best, you do not grow; at worst, you get hurt. On top of all that, it is almost impossible to master these techniques without building the physical fitness (strength, stamina, agility, and flexibility) to perform them.</p>
<p>Jui-Jitsu is humbling. During the first few months of training, I learned that no matter how athletic I am or how many academic papers I have published, I will suck at this game. After five rounds of grappling, I realized that my stamina from all the recreational soccer (real football) did not cut it, and I wanted to throw up. I also realized that while I trust fellow students and professors not to break me, I must let go of my ego and tap early. Otherwise, I will get hurt. I will feel strangled to death by an elderly or someone 40 pounds less heavy than me.</p>
<p>If one asks me if it was easier to get a PhD than a blue belt in Jui-Jitsu, I would say they were both as challenging. Once I got a hold of the basics and got over my ego, I realized I knew nothing. This experience is comparable to how a PhD student feels after a year. That is when you start to learn the techniques correctly. But just like the PhD, you will want to quit now and then. And all you can do is show up every day until you have a breakthrough.</p>
<p>The injuries are not too bad, and it is almost always your fault. The lack of focus, letting your ego take over your mind, and replicating moves from youtube without learning proper techniques can lead to injuries. It is unfortunate, but most injuries in recreational Jui-Jitsu either happen by white belts or happen to white belts. You can say once one gets the blue belt in Jui-Jitsu, one finally understands how to handle themselves on the mat to defend and not hurt yourself or others. Bad examples: I tried replicating Eddy Bravo&rsquo;s butterfly guard from YouTube in the early days and ended up getting my knee twisted in an unusual situation (out for three weeks). I got too excited (by my ego) to do some card wheel pass, but I hit the mat with a twisted foot (out for two weeks). Improper double-leg takedown technique, and the next thing you know, the opponent&rsquo;s knee is striking your face (striking is not part of the Jui-Jitsu training).</p>
<p>Getting choked out is scary and fun. Yes, that happens; you heard that correctly. It sounds scarier than it is. Various Jui-Jitsu chokeholds can block the artery, and if you do not tap early, you will pass out. There has not been enough evidence to show that this is bad for humans and is considered safe in various combat sports. I got choked out two times. The first time, I tried to say the word tap instead of physically tapping on the opponent. He did not hear me, so I was out. The second time, I was distracted, so I didn&rsquo;t tap!! So all I had to do to avoid these incidents was tap early and loudly and not be distracted. Why is it scary and fun? Getting choked out causes some psychosis for a few seconds. When this happened to me, everything slowed down around me before I was out, and I woke up very refreshed, feeling like I had a great 8 hours of night sleep. In reality, I was only out for 3-5 seconds.</p>
<p>Like any other achievements in life: publishing a top-tier paper, defending a PhD, getting a dream job, I feel joy about this minor milestone in my Jui-Jitsu journey. The reality is getting a blue belt in Jui-Jitsu could be as absurd as getting a paper in a top-tier academic conference or, even worse, finishing the PhD dissertation (almost nobody reads that shit). The reality is in the big scheme of things, one more paper or one more belt promotion does not matter much, but they are all good excuses for celebrating. Now that I have celebrated this achievement, I can return to the mat and enjoy Jui-Jitsu, regardless of my belt. What matters is that Jui-Jitsu has transformed my life in incomparable ways. I feel more confident and safer in my body compared to five years ago. I also have learned a lot of life lessons on the mat: Never give up, work hard, be humble, and be mindful.</p>
